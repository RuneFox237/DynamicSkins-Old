## NOTE: This Repository holds the Old version of DynamicSkins - This process still works. but will be replaced by a more streamlined version at a later date. Naming it now so I can use the regular DynamicSkins space for the new version 

# DynamicSkins
An attempt at making it easier to add DynamicBones to Custom Skins of Standard Characters for RoR2.
Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/RuneFox237/DynamicSkins-Old/wiki) for a tutorial on how to use the scripts.

Thanks to KingEnderBrine for the initial tutorials on how to create custom skins as well as the first custom skin that contained additional Dynamic Bones, without which this project wouldn't be possible. 

Example Project using the scripts

## Blender Py Scripts
With the Survivors of the Void update to RoR2 came changes to the game's file system which made the old way of ripping unreliable. These are the blender scripts I use in my workflow to reorder and fix the bones of ripped models. They are modified from [KingEnderBrines original blender scripts](https://github.com/KingEnderBrine/-RoR2-BlenderScripts) and meant to be used with [this specific workflow](https://github.com/RuneFox237/DynamicSkins/wiki/Ripping-Characters-for-skins-from-RoR2-Post-SotV)
