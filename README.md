# DynamicSkins
An attempt at making it easier to add DynamicBones to Custom Skins of Standard Characters for RoR2.
Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/RuneFox237/DynamicSkins/wiki) for a tutorial on how to use the scripts.

Thanks to KingEnderBrine for the initial tutorials on how to create custom skins as well as the first custom skin that contained additional Dynamic Bones, without which this project wouldn't be possible.
